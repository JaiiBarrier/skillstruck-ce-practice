#	THIS IS A COMMENT THAT WILL NOT AFFECT THE CODE. 


#BASIC PYTHON RULES: 
#	Line Order - from Top to Bottom 

#	Whitespace - variable1 vs variable 1

#	Case Sensitive
# 		print("Hello World") vs Print("Hello World")
 
	
	
	
	
	
	
#WHAT IS A PRINT STATEMENT?
#  The output of what the user & console sees


# -- TYPE & TRY THIS EXAMPLE -- print("Hello World")
# print("Hey Yalllllll")

# print("Hello World")





























# WHAT IS A VARIABLE? - An Identifier.   A building block for programming that is basically a holding box for different data types. Think of your name!


# 1. Must either be one word, or connected with underscores.  


# VALID
# name = "Jaii"

# first_name ="Jaii"

# INVALID

# first_name = "Jaii"





# 2. A variable name must start with a letter or an underscore character _.  It CANNOT start with a number. 
# AND No special characters are allowed.


# VALID


# INVALID




# How do we print a variable? Line Order



# What's the difference between print("car") & print(car)?


# car = "Benz"
# # print("car")

# print(car)








# *********** ANY QUESTIONS????? *********** 



#	Can you combine variables together? 
#		Yes - with Concatenation! But How? 



# car = "red"
# new_car = "blue"




# print("Words right here" + " " + car)





# *********** ANY QUESTIONS????? *********** 










#What are the different Variable Types?
# 	String // name = "age"
# 	Integer // age = 22
# 	Boolean // hungry = True




# STRING - a text value







# INTEGER / FLOAT - two different ways to display numbers






# How do I execute math in Python?
# ADDITION [+]


age = 5
new_year = 7




# SUBTRACTION [-]




# MULTIPLICATION [*]





# DIVISION [/]







#What is Input/Output?
#	Inviting the user to give a response (input) for the program to process and display (output).





first_name = input("What is your first name?")

print(first_name)


print("My name is " + first_name)
